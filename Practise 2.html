                <p>
                    A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, and ingenious scientist, Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark
                    suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force him to build a
                    weapon of mass destruction, he instead creates a powered suit of armor to save his life and escape
                    captivity. Later, Stark develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological devices he
                    designed through his company, Stark Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to protect
                    the world as Iron Man. Although at first concealing his true identity, Stark eventually declared
                    that he was, in fact, Iron Man in a public announcement.

                <h2>Captain America</h2>
                <p>

                    The character wears a costume bearing an American flag motif, and he utilizes a nearly
                    indestructible shield which he throws as a projectile. Captain America is the alter ego of Steve
                    Rogers, a frail young man enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental serum to aid
                    the United States government's efforts in World War II. Near the end of the war, he was trapped in
                    ice and survived in suspended animation until he was revived in the present day. Although Captain
                    America often struggles to maintain his ideals as a man out of his time with its modern realities,
                    he remains a highly respected figure in his community which includes becoming the long-time leader
                    of the Avengers.
